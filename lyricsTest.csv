0,ego-remix,2009,beatles,Pop,"Oh baby, how you doing?
You know I'm gonna cut right to the chase
Some women were made but me, myself
I like to think that I was created for a special purpose
You know, what's more special than you? You feel me..."
1,honesty,2009,beyonce-knowles,Pop,"If you search
For tenderness
It isn't hard to find
You can have the love
You need to live
But if you look
For truthfulness"
2,you-are-my-rock,2009,beyonce-knowles,Pop,"Oh oh oh I, oh oh oh I
[Verse 1:]
If I wrote a book about where we stand
Then the title of my book would be ""Life with Superman""
That's how you make me feel I count you as a privilege
This love is so ideal
I'm honored to be in it
I know you feel the same I see it everyday
In all the things you do
In all the things you say
[Chorus:]
You are my rock
Baby you're the truth
You are my rock
I love to rock with you
You are my rock
You're everything I need
You are my rock
So baby rock with me
I wanna kiss ya, feel ya, please ya just right
I wanna touch ya, love ya, baby all night
Reward ya, for all the things you do
You are my rock
I love to rock with you
I love to rock with you
Oh oh oh I"
3,black-culture,2009,beyonce-knowles,Pop,"Party the people, the people the party it's popping no sitting around,
I see you looking you looking I see you I look at what you started now
Let's hook up little one on one up come on give some of the that stuff,
Let me freshin' it with no ruff (let's go)
Let's hook up when we start we won't stop,
Baby, baby don't stop come on give me some of that stuff (let's go)
I am, Black Culture
I am, Black Culture
I am, Black Culture"
